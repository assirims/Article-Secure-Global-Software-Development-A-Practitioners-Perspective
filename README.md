## Abstract
Global software development (GSD) is rapidly becoming standard practice in the software industry due to its many potential benefits. However, one of the biggest challenges in GSD projects is to explicitly include security in the different phases of the global software development life cycle (GSDLC). To make GSD projects secure and successful, it is necessary to identify secure software development (SSD) practices vital to GSD project success. This article aims to identify SSD practices critical for GSD projects. To do this, we selected 36 security practices vital to the security of non-GSD projects from existing scientific and grey literature on software security. From the identified security practices, we shortlisted the security practices which are critical for GSD projects based on practitionersâ€™ opinions using an online survey. Fifty-four GSD practitioners participated in this survey. Participants who evaluated these practices were asked to score each SSD practice on a four-point scale to indicate its relevance to GSD projects. The results obtained from the survey uncovered critical SSD practices that are primarily applicable to GSD projects. Our findings reveal variations of opinion among GSD practitioners with varying experience and company size regarding the importance of selected security practices for GSD. According to study findings, 16/36 practices are critical for GSD projects. These identified security practices belong to various phases of GSDLC.
